# Tele-HealthCare
Developed a Java Swing Application to provide a better healthcare solution by decreasing the cost of the organization, 
while maintaining and providing an improved and end – to – end healthcare platform.

The application implemented the concept of Internet of Things, where it leveraged the data provided by the by remote monitoring devices like Pressure Transducers, installed in the homes of post-operative and elderly patients to continuously monitor the vital signs and alert the nearest clinic in case of any abnormal activity. 

Software Engineering concepts like Design Patterns, Event Driven Architecture (queue based messaging) and algorithmic complexity were kept in mind.

Integrated the application with Skype, so that the doctor can interact with the patients directly and get an online diagnosis if possible. The prescription can be directly sent to the patient via email, along with barcodes to provide proper authentication.

The idea behind this project was to
- To create a healthcare provider service where the patients do not need to visit the hospital, except for emergencies or surgeries, and get a diagnosis directly via skype chat conferencing.
- The patients, once registered by an enterprise hospital, can book an appointment with the doctor, who can send the prescription directly to the patient through an e-mail with an authenticated barcode after diagnosis.
- if the patient moves to some other city or state, The same enterprise across different states can access their patient’s medical records using the centralized database available
